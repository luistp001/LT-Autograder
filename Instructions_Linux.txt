Intructions to test and train the autograder system

These instructions are for Linux only.

FOR TESTING

The following procedure will produce exactly the same file that I sent to Kaggle for 
the private leaderboard. 
If you wish to train the files neccesary for testing yourself, you can do it following 
the procedure described in the 'FOR TRAINING SECTION'.

1. Copy the file to be tested (private_leaderboard.tsv) to the to the directory /TestFile
2. Change the name of the file to 'test.tsv'

Using the terminal:
3. cd to the folder TestCode 
Type: 
4. python preProcessData.py
5. Rscript predict_labels.R
6. Rscript modelingRf.R
7. Rscript modelingGbm.R
8. Rscript AveModels.R

The final predictions of the file test.tsv will saved in the directory 
/TestCode/finalModel with the name 'finalPrediction.csv'

FOR TRAINING:

Warning: It may take days to be completely trained. To reduce training time, you can change some
of the parameters described in 'PARAMETERS SECTION'. Those changes may also reduce performance.
If you are planning to make these changes, go to the 'PARAMETERS SECTION' before doing any of the
following steps.

1. Copy the training file to the directory /TrainingFile
2. Make sure the name of the training file is 'train_rel_2.tsv', if not, rename it.
Using the terminal:
3. cd to the folder TrainingCode 
Type: 
4. python preProcessData.py
5. Rscript predict_label_boruta.R
6. Rscript predict_label.R
7. Rscript variable_selection.R
8. Rscript modelingRf.R
9. Rscript modelingGbm.R

The files neccesary for testing will be save. To use those files for testing, copy and replace 
all the files from from /newTrainedModelFiles to /alreadySavedModelFiles. 
Then follow the procedure described for testing. It could produce slightly different results 
because of the stochasticity of the Random Forest algorithm.

PARAMETERS:

The next changes will reduce training time but may reduce the performance as well. 

In the file predict_label_boruta.R, there are 6 parameters that could be modified. These are ntreep 
and maxRunsp for type w, b and t respectively. My chosen values are

    if (type == 'w'){
    ntreep = 37
    maxRunsp = 150
    }
    if (type == 'b'){
    ntreep = 37
    maxRunsp = 100
    }
    if (type == 't'){
    ntreep = 31
    maxRunsp = 100
    }

Reducing the value of one or more of them will reduce training time.

In the file /TrainingCode/predict_label.R, ntrees, ncv and ntry can be modified to a lower value. As a 
suggestion, the training time to run this script is approximately linear to the ntry value, 
but using an ntry of 1 instead of 5 may not reduce considerably the performance.

In the file /TrainingCode/variable_selection.R, the values of maxRunp_fw, maxRunp_b, and ntrees can be reduced.
In the file /TrainingCode/modelingRf.R, the value of ntrees can be reduced.
In the file /TrainingCode/modelingGbm.R, the values of ntrees can be reduced, but in this case, the change may
considerably reduce the performance.
